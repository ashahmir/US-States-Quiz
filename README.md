# 🗺️ U.S. States Guessing Game

This is a Python-based interactive game that helps you learn and test your knowledge of the 50 U.S. states using the `turtle` graphics module and `pandas`.

## 🎮 How It Works

- A blank map of the U.S. is displayed.
- You're prompted to guess the name of a U.S. state.
- If the guess is correct, the state name appears at the correct location on the map.
- You can keep guessing until all 50 states are correctly guessed.
- Type **Exit** to stop the game at any time.
- At the end, a CSV file named `missing_states.csv` is generated with the list of states you didn't guess.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.py` - The game script.
- `50_states.csv` - Dataset containing state names and their (x, y) coordinates.
- `blank_states_img.gif` - Background image of the U.S. map.
- `missing_states.csv` - (Auto-generated) List of states not guessed correctly.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `turtle` (usually comes built-in with Python)

You can install `pandas` via pip:
  pip install pandas
